As you can understand from the title, my full name is İbrahim Dağcı ;) Currently, I am a third-year student in the Computer Engineering department at Konya Technical University, taking steps towards becoming an active developer. I can say that I am generally an introverted person. I prefer formal environments, but I can also be in casual settings when necessary.
